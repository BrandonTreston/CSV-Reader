# CSV-Reader

The objective of this program is to read input from a user provided CSV file, take each line of the
CSV and create an array to store each comma separated value as a unique element in that array.

The purpose for creating this program was to assist with a school project in which I had to read
CSV input to create objects that simulated processes running on a CPU. I thought it would be a (very)
simple way to store CSV values for easy access and manipulation.

Currently, this program only works with CSV values not enclosed in quotes (" "), however I plan to add this
functionality in the future.
